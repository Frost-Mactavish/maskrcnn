**The overall framework of our method.** The top side illustrates the Bridge Past and Future (BPF) procedure, which identifies objects of past classes and excludes several potential objects of future classes to ensure consistent optimization during the entire training process. The bottom side shows the Distillation with Future (DwF) process, which employs both the old model $\mathcal{M}_{t-1}$ adept at detecting old categories and the interim model $\mathcal{M}_{t}^{im}$ trained on $\mathcal{D}_t$ and specialized in new categories to conduct a comprehensive distillation across all categories for the current model $\mathcal{M}_t$.

**Visualization of Bridge Past and Future.** Boxes in $\textcolor{red}{\text{red}}$ represent the ground truth in the current stage. **(a)** In Bridge the Past, we effectively constructed pseudo labels of past classes. **(b)** In Bridge the Future, salient objects (marked in $\textcolor{green}{\text{green}}$ boxes) can be easily detected from the attention maps and are excluded from the background regions. Best viewed in color.
